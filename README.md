# Mottled
Two Dimensional Pattern Recognition with Prediction

Mottled combs through a sequence of real valued data looking for unique and similar patterns that are 2 dimensional. It rates patterns
based on the number of occurances that a given pattern exists in the data (and other customizable factors). Using the input file provided 
(allForexData.csv) and the base parameters provided, it achieves roughly 50% accuracy at predicting the next line of real valued data.

allForexData.csv is a collection of hourly Forex Data for AUDUSD commodity. It can be scaled for multiple columns and rows of data.

MottledTuning.ods is a spreadsheet of (some) of the tuning I've done to attempt accuracy.
